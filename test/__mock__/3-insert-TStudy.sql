History: A 71-year-old woman with lung cancer at RUL S/P surgery on 11/11/2016. This study is requested to evaluate bony metastasis. 



Findings: The study reveals hot spot at posterior right 7th rib and linear increased tracer uptake at anterolateral right 7th rib that is possible post surgical inflammation as correlated with history. If clinical suspicious of otherwise, please correlate with other investigation and follow up bone scan next 3-6 months.

          Mildly increased tracer uptake at right temporal bone as compared with the left may be benign cause. However, bony metastasis cannot be totally excluded, please correlate with other investigation or follow up bone scan. 

          Increased tracer uptake at right sternoclavicular region and L2-L4 vertebrae is possible degenerative change until proven otherwise. Please correlate with clinical, other investigation or follow up bone scan.

          Increased tracer uptake at both shoulders and left knee is possible degenerative or inflammatory change.

          The skeletal elsewhere appears unremarkable. 



Impression:

1. Bony lesions at posterior right 7th rib and anterolateral right 7th rib is possible post surgical inflammation as correlated with history. If clinical suspicious of otherwise, please correlate with other investigation and follow up bone scan next 3-6 months.

2. Prominently bony uptake at right temporal bone as compared with the left may be benign cause. However, bony metastasis cannot be totally excluded, please correlate with other investigation or follow up bone scan.
